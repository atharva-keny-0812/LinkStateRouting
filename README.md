## Description
This project is a simulation of a routing network utilizing the Link State Routing Algorithm and Protocol. The main goal is to provide a platform to understand and analyze the behavior of routing networks under various conditions. The Link State Routing Algorithm is a distributed routing algorithm that calculates the shortest path to each node in the network based on a global view of the network topology. In this simulation, we implement the Link State Routing Algorithm to construct routing tables for each router in the network. These routing tables are then utilized to simulate communication between routers.

The simulation considers scenarios such as link failures, sudden changes in link costs, and simultaneous packet transmissions. By simulating these scenarios, the project aims to demonstrate how the routing network adapts and recalculates routes dynamically in response to network changes. Through this simulation, users can gain insights into the behavior and performance of routing networks and understand the importance of robust routing algorithms in real-world networking scenarios.
